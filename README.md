** declaimer : this project is only for learning purposes and I will not claim this as my personal project 

## 10 things that I learn from this project:
1) python programming 
2) type of machine learning 
3) knowledge about reinforcement learning 
4) learn how to implement different python library particularly pytorch and matlibplot  
5) neural network 
6) deepQ learning 
7) using virtual enviroment in python 
8) using visual studio code extension to improve code readability and write a cleaner code
9) learn about what python programming language can do 
10) learn to use anaconda distribution

## 3 things I did to learn the most out of this project : 
1) do extensive research when I encountered some knowledge that new to me 
2) understand the code thoroughly before start coding 
3) jot down note about the thing that I learn
